The following tag attributes are used: `<a>`:`<a class="wpaudio" href="https://sitename.com/path/filename.mp3" title="Track caption" alt="Track discription" data-artist="Artist name" data-album="Album title" data-length="123">Track title</a>`* `class="wpaudio"` - class name of the link to the audio file. By default: **wpaudio**. Can be changed in plugin settings.* `href="https://sitename.com/path/filename.mp3"` - audio file URL. Relative path is allowed (by default relative to the site root).* `title="Track caption"` - the track title - displayed in the player header. If **title** is not specified, the link text (track title) and artist name is displayed instead.* `alt="Track discription"` - track discription.* `data-artist="Artist name"` - artist name.* `data-album="Album title"` - album title. If the album title is not set in this tag, then the album title  is the post title.* `data-length="123"` - track length in seconds. * `Track title - link text`  - track title. If is empty, the value of the **title** attribute is accepted. If **title** is also empty, then track title is filename **filename.mp3**.To set **track image** paste it into the link text:`<a class="wpaudio" ...><img src="https://sitename.com/path/image.png" width="48" height="64" />Track title</a>`In automatic mode (default is off), the plug-in parse the post contents and instead of the text that located between the first and last audio links, inserts the standard WP player with playlist that included of the found audio links.If for a post to create an custom field **single_audio** with any value other than an empty string, then each link will be treated as a separate playlist with a single track.**Enclosing shortcode** `[audiodisk] ... [/audiodisk]` allows you to reduce the range of search for links on the page to text located inside the shortcode tags. This gives you more flexibility to edit posts, allows you to create multiple playlists on single page. **Self-closing shortcode** `[audiodisk src ="https://sitename.com/path/playlist.m3u"]` allows you to insert a player with a pre-configured playlist,there is **src** - link to the playlist file in the formats **m3u** or **pls**. You can set relative path to the file.The plugin adds "Downoad" button for each track in the standard WP player.You can disable playlist looping with same named option. == Screenshots == 1.
